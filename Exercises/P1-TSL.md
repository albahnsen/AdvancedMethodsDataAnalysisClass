# P1 - Time Series Analysis

Due date: June 22nd at midnight

- The result of your analysis will be evaluated from a report in Jupiter, which must be found in a public GitHub repository.
- The project must be carried out in groups of 4 people.
- Use clear and rigorous procedures.
- The delivery of the project is on June 22, 2020, 11:59 pm, through Sicua + (Upload repository link).
-Projects will not be received after the delivery time or by any other means than the one established.

The project seeks to analyze a question of interest, which can be framed within a context, in order to interpret the results

1. Choosing your time series (Friday June 12th).

For the project, each group must select a dataset of their choice where the analysis can be performed using a time series model. There are many sources of time series data on the Internet. Government agencies are some of the best sources. But be resourceful. It is better to find a data set is from a process that interests you. Use a recent time-series, also try to avoid a tipical stock-price / exchange rates series. The selected time series must be sent no later than Friday, June 12 11:59 pm, through Sicua +, for approval.

The analysis of the data using time series must consider:

2. Analysis of the context of the problem and relevance of the analysis: This should answer the question of why it is interesting or important to study the selected data.

3. Understanding the data: Understand and analyze the main components of the time series, for example: seasonality, cyclicity, autocorrelation, behavior of the residuals, among others. Make use of graphs that allow you to understand each of the components clearly.

4. Application of the model in predictions: Correct use of the models seen in class to make predictions related to the problem of interest.

5. Conclusions: The conclusions must be relevant to the problem of interest. Conclusions on the procedures performed are also expected.
