    "## Text Similarities : Estimate the degree of similarity between two texts\n",
    "\n",
    "We always need to compute the similarity in meaning between texts.\n",
    "* Search engines need to model the relevance of a document to a query, beyond the overlap in words between the two. For instance, question-and-answer sites such as Quora or Stackoverflow need to determine whether a question has already been asked before.\n",
    "* In legal matters, text similarity task allow to mitigate risks on a new contract, based on the assumption that if a new contract is similar to a existent one that has been proved to be resilient, the risk of this new contract being the cause of financial loss is minimised. Here is the principle of Case Law principle. Automatic linking of related documents ensures that identical situations are treated similarly in every case. Text similarity foster fairness and equality. Precedence retrieval of legal documents is an information retrieval task to retrieve prior case documents that are related to a given case document.\n",
    "* In customer services, AI system should be able to understand semantically similar queries from users and provide a uniform response. The emphasis on semantic similarity aims to create a system that recognizes language and word patterns to craft responses that are similar to how a human conversation works. For example, if the user asks “What has happened to my delivery?” or “What is wrong with my shipping?”, the user will expect the same response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is text similarity?\n",
    "Text similarity has to determine how ‘close’ two pieces of text are both in surface closeness [lexical similarity] and meaning [semantic similarity]."

    "Mathematically speaking, Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of 0° is 1, and it is less than 1 for any angle in the interval (0,π] radians. It is thus a judgment of orientation and not magnitude: two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1, two vectors oriented at 90° relative to each other have a similarity of 0, and two vectors diametrically opposed have a similarity of -1, independent of their magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.\n"

    "It is common to find in many sources that the first step to cluster text data is to transform text units to vectors. This is not 100% true. But this step depends mostly on the similarity measure and the clustering algorithm. Some of the best performing text similarity measures don’t use vectors at all. This is the case of the winner system in SemEval2014 sentence similarity task which uses lexical word alignment. However, vectors are more efficient to process and allow to benefit from existing ML/DL algorithms.\n",
