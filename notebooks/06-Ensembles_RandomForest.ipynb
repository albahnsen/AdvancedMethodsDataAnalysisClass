    "Random Forests is a **slight variation of bagged trees** that has even better performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exactly like bagging, we create an ensemble of decision trees using bootstrapped samples of the training set.\n",
    "- However, when building each tree, each time a split is considered, a **random sample of m features** is chosen as split candidates from the **full set of p features**. The split is only allowed to use **one of those m features**.\n",
    "    - A new random sample of features is chosen for **every single tree at every single split**.\n",
    "    - For **classification**, m is typically chosen to be the square root of p.\n",
    "    - For **regression**, m is typically chosen to be somewhere between p/3 and p.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the point?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose there is **one very strong feature** in the data set. When using bagged trees, most of the trees will use that feature as the top split, resulting in an ensemble of similar trees that are **highly correlated**.\n",
    "- Averaging highly correlated quantities does not significantly reduce variance (which is the entire goal of bagging).\n",
    "- By randomly leaving out candidate features from each split, **Random Forests \"decorrelates\" the trees**, such that the averaging process can reduce the variance of the resulting model."
